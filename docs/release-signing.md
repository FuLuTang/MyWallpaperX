# Release signing and notarization

GitHub Actions builds are signed and notarized before being attached to GitHub Releases. Configure these repository secrets before relying on release downloads:

- `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`: Base64-encoded `.p12` export of the Developer ID Application certificate.
- `P12_PASSWORD`: Password for the exported `.p12`.
- `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`: Temporary CI keychain password. Any strong generated value is fine.
- `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION`: Full signing identity, for example `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)`.
- `APPLE_ID`: Apple Developer account email.
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: App-specific password for notarization.
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Apple Developer Team ID.

Create `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` locally after exporting the Developer ID Application certificate from Keychain Access:

```bash
base64 -i DeveloperIDApplication.p12 | pbcopy
```

The workflow intentionally fails early when any signing secret is missing. Unsigned macOS downloads often show as damaged because Gatekeeper cannot verify the app.
